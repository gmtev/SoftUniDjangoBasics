# SoftUniDjangoBasics
In this repository I'm going to store the code I've written for SoftUni's "Django Basics" course, part of the Python Web module. The uploads consist of the exam preparation tasks and the exam itself. It's important to note that the static files and template designs are made by SoftUni's team and that the students only write the template functionality.
